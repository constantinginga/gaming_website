                <h1>Rocket League club</h1>
                <p> Rocket League is a vehicular soccer video game developed and published by @caedizs. Described as
                    "soccer, but with rocket-powered cars", Rocket League has up to eight players assigned to each of
                    the two teams, using rocket-powered vehicles to hit a ball into their opponent's goal and score
                    points over the course of a match. The game includes single-player and multiplayer modes which can
                    be played both locally and online, including cross-platform play between all versions. Later updates
                    for the game enabled the ability to modify core rules and added new game modes, including ones based
                    on ice hockey and basketball.</p>

                    Your options in Terraria are limitless. Are you an action gamer with an itchy trigger finger? A
                    master builder? A collector? An explorer? There's something for everyone. Start by building basic
                    shelter, then dig for ore and other resources. Discover and craft over 500 weapons of magic, ranged,
                    melee and summon varieties, as well as armor, and use them to battle hundreds of different enemies.
                    Soon you'll be going head-to-head with any of a dozen enormous bosses. Go fishing, ride a mount,
                    find Floating Islands, build houses for helpful NPCs, and much, much more.</p>

                <h1>League of Legends club</h1>
                <p>League of Legends (abbreviated LoL) is a multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and
                    published by Riot Games for Microsoft Windows and macOS. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, the
                    game follows a freemium model. The game was released on October 27, 2009. An abridged version of the
                    game called League of Legends: Wild Rift for mobile and console, was announced on October 15, 2019.
                    In League of Legends, players assume the role of a "champion" with unique abilities, varying around
                    their class, and battle against a team of other player- or computer-controlled champions. In the
                    main game mode, Summoner's Rift, the goal is to destroy the opposing team's Nexus, a structure that
                    lies at the heart of their base, protected by defensive structures. The setting of the game,
                    Runeterra, has been expanded through a variety of media, including short stories, comic books,
                    computer-generated cinematics, and spin-off games.</p>

                <h1>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive club</h1>
                <p>Global Offensive, like prior games in the Counter-Strike series, is an objective-based, multiplayer
                    first-person shooter. Two opposing teams, known as the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists,
                    compete in game modes to complete objectives, such as securing a location to plant or defuse a bomb
                    and rescuing or guarding hostages. At the end of each round, players are rewarded based on their
                    individual performance with in-game currency to spend on other weapons or utility in subsequent
                    rounds. Winning rounds rewards more money than losing does, and completing objectives such as
                    killing enemies gives cash bonuses. Uncooperative actions, such as killing teammates, result in a
                    penalty.</p>
