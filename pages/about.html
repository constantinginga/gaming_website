                    notice that I was too lazy to write something interesting here. Totally not noticable and I will
                    have totally clear concious when I will hand this in without any kind of fear that I could fail. Not
                    nervous at all. Totally. Right? Who would be nervous about handing in some html file. Hah! Not this
                    guy. Not at all! Totally! Oh boy. I should stop procrastinating and start writing something
                    intereting. Eh. Did you know that the Food and Drug Administration has a handbook detailing the
                    levels of “insect fragments” and other icky-sounding contaminants that are safe for humans to
